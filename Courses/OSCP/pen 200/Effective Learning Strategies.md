# [Learning Theory](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/effective-learning-strategies/learning-theory/memory-mechanisms-and-dual-coding)

One of the ways we can demonstrate that we have learned something is to create and retrieve memories.  

We can improve our capacity to create and retrieve memories by doing the following:

- Improve the quality of the information that we take in;
- Improve the way or mode in which we receive information; and
- Improve our practice of retrieving information.

Taking in the same information via a secondary method, for example reading and explanation and watching a video about the same module, is call '[Dual Coding](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/brain-based-learning-myth-versus-reality-testing-learning-styles-and-dual-coding/)'.

## [Tactics and Common Methods](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/effective-learning-strategies/tactics-and-common-methods/tactics-and-common-methods)

> Strategy without tactics is the slowest way to victory.  Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat - Sun Tzu

Strategy can be thought of as the map and tactics as the steps that need to be taken.

This section covers the following:

1. Understand/adopt one potential note taking method called 'Cornell Notes';
2. Learn about retrieval Practice;
3. Understand Spaced Practice;
4. Explore the SQ3R and PQ4R Methods;
5. Examine the Feynman Technique; and
6. Understand the Leitner System.

## My Strategies

When will I study?

How long will I study for?

Where will I study?

Which method will I use?

How will I review how my study went?

How will I take notes and utilise them?
