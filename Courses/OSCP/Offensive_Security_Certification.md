# Offensive Security - OSCP Plan

Recent changes to OSCP content have meant that a lot of the content that I have completed are in different places now.  I currently have the 'Learn Fundamentals' subscription, which unfortunately has time limits on using the machines.  I will upgrade my subscription to 'Learn One'.  Under the new syllabus with Offensive Security, I will need to select a course.  I thought it was worth exploring whether or not OSCP (PEN 200) is still the right choice.  The Web 200 and SOC 200 also look interesting and relevant.

I'll aim to complete all of the Pen 103 content and the exam before my subscription ends in August.  I'll upgrade my subscription to 'Learn One' and select either OSCP, WEB200 or SOC 200.  Advice on this would be great.

I've added what I've completed so far, including on other sites as well.
