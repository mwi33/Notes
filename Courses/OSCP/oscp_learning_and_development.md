# Offensive Security - OSCP Plan

Recent changes to OSCP content have meant that a lot of the content that I have completed are in different places now.  I currently have the 'Learn Fundamentals' subscription, which unfortunately has time limits on playing the machines.  I will upgrade my subscription to 'Learn One'.  Under the new arrangement with Offensive Security, I will need to select a course.  I thought it was worth exploring whether or not OSCP (PEN 200) is still the right choice.

Since the changes, I've now been added into 'Pen 103'.

After completing 'Pen 103' I have to choose a course.  I had planned to select 'Pen 200 - OSCP', however I could also select 'Web 200' or 'SOC 200'.
