# Diffie-Hellman key exchange
This algorithm is used to calculate shared keys using independently selected public and private keys.

g = public (prime) base  
p = public (prime) base 

a = private key - party 1
b = private key - party 2

A = public key party 1
B = public key party 2

S = shared key
